# AXIAL Replication for Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning Course

This repository contains the project for the "Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning" course, focused on replicating the results presented in the AXIAL paper for explainable Alzheimer's disease prediction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to reproduce the findings of the AXIAL paper by following a similar methodology, leveraging publicly available data and high-performance computing resources. We aimed to understand and implement the techniques used for predicting Alzheimer's disease while emphasizing model explainability.

## Methodology

The replication process involved the following key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition**: Data was downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    *   Initial preprocessing was performed using the Clinica software toolkit.
    *   Further custom preprocessing steps were implemented using Python scripts.
3.  **Model Training**:
    *   The model was retrained using the best configuration specified by the authors of the original AXIAL paper.
    *   Training was performed on the JEDI cluster at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, utilizing NVIDIA GH200 GPUs.
4. **Model Evaluation**
